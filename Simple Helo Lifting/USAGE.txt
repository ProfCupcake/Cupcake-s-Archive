TO INSTALL:

Just copy the "scripts" folder into the mission folder, then either copy the init.sqf into your mission folder or, if your init.sqf already exists, copy the following line into it:

[["blacklisted ground/sea vehicles"],["blacklisted helicopters"]] execVM "scripts\lift_init.sqf";

If you wish to disallow certain vehicles to be lifted, you can put them in the first array there, marked "blacklisted ground/sea vehicles". 
If you wish to disallow certain helicopters from lifting, you can put them in the second array, marked "blacklisted helicopters". 
You can use either the classnames or the names of specific vehicles for the blacklists. 
NOTE: If you use names set in the editor, enter it as a variable (not a string, so without the quotation marks). If it is a classname, enter it as a string (i.e. within quotation marks). 

And that's it. 

TO USE:

It works via actions, which will pop up when available. 

Prerequisites for lifting: 

 - You are in a helicopter
 - Your helicopter is not already carrying something
 - You are the pilot
 - You are travelling no more than 10 km/h
 - There is a nearby ground/sea vehicle for you to lift (no more than 20 metres away)
 - The helicopter you are in is not blacklisted

There is no prerequisite for dropping vehicles other than that you are actually carrying a vehicle to drop.
